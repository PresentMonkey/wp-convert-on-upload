# WP-convert-on-upload
Converts HEIC images to JPG on upload

### Requirements

Requires `php-imagick` for image processing. 

### Why?

Was frustrurated there were no plugins that converted the frusturating HEIC format to a usable one on upload to wordpress site. Decided to write it myself. Very rudimentary for now.
